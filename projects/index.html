            <h2>Cocktail Party</h2>
            <h3>Many students want to find the chances to talk with some professionals, in order to get to know more about the industry they are interested in and then make their career goal clearer. We would conduct a cocktail party, which would provide the opportunity to let Chinese student know more about the culture of networking in USA. In the event, many guest speakers would be invited, including professionals from media, journalism, entrepreneurship, finance, technology and real estate. </h3>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Freshmen Airport Pickup</h2>
            <h3>We would inform the new students that our organization would offer the service to meet them at the airport and drive them to their residence through the social media (Wechat). And then we would recruit abundant volunteers, who have been in USC for many years. After that, we would design a form for the new students to fill in online. The form includes their personal information, phone number and their departure time and arrival time. After collecting the responses from the new students, we would match them with the volunteers who are available during their arrival time by telling them the telephone number or Wechat Id of the matched volunteers and students. This service is not totally for free, each student need to pay the volunteer 15 dollars, and our organization would give the volunteers 10-dollar allowance. </h3>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
            <h3>The funds and the materials and supplies mainly come from the sponsors, who build cooperative partnerships with our organization. Since we are living in California, an area Chinese densely populate in, we would make the best of the resource. We will exploit our resource of great population of Chinese students, in order to attract many Chinese companies, restaurants and private vendors to make promotion in USC through our organization. The students in Liaison Department would get abundant chances to negotiate with the sponsors, which will hone their social skills and the capabilities to handle practical problems. We would use the methods of setting booths, promoting through our official social media, pasting flyers and so on to satisfy the sponsors. And of course the price is clearly listed in our price catalogue.</h3>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Spring Festival Gala & Mid-Autumn Festival Gala</h2>
            <h3>Chinese mid-autumn festival and Spring festival are two of the most important traditional festivals in China. However, we cannot get back home to celebrate them with our families. So during these festivals, our organizations would conduct a gala to gather Chinese together to celebrate. There will be booths for students to play games, foods and drinks will be provided (moon cakes and dumplings), two shows would be also included. The performers in the shows would be the students who sign up voluntarily, and we would select the better ones in the official performance. At the end of the shows, we would also conduct a lucky draw with rich prizes. </h3>
